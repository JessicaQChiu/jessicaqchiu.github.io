                    <div class="col-md-8">
                        <p>I'm a New Zealand business/IT graduate with professional experience working in the financial
                            technology industry hoping to build a career in front-end development.
                            I am open to developer opportunities in Vancouver or remote work in Canada.
                            Being an operations analyst in a startup environment allowed me to build many transferrable
                            skills such as learning new procedures, compliance with standards/practices, writing
                            documentation, taking initiative with improvements, and more.
                            Near the end of the NZ COVID-19 lockdown, I recognised the importance of being online -
                            studying, working, connecting with others. I also recognised how a lot of technology isn't
                            accessible - this inspired me to take the leap and pursue sustainable web development.
                            <br><br>
                            My first experiences with technology included playing games on a boxy PC. Neopets was a
                            popular website during my childhood. When I discovered that I could customise my profile
                            page - the cursor, colours, and add animations that would show for all my friends online, I
                            was wonderstruck.
                            Curiousity played a large part in my interest in tech and changing that single cursor design
                            lead me down a path of developing interfaces for friends to use, programming a robotic arm,
                            and volunteering to help spark that same enthusiasm in others.
                            <br><br>
                            I want to move forward by persistently developing my skills, diving into the knowledge
                            of others, collaborating on cool projects, and providing my own perspective designing
                            responsive, accessible web apps.

                            People have always been at the center of my work and previous roles. I would love the
                            opportunity to be a part of a team that helps create a positive impact on how information is
                            used, communicated, and shared - to help create solutions or paths so anyone (regardless of
                            what technology they use to browse the web) can find them.

                            I hope to collaborate and bring my perspective of inclusion,
                            accessibility, and sustainability when developing strategies and products.
                            <br><br>
                            It's difficult to summarise my sincerity to enter this industry and how I will be diligent
                            in my contributions - but it is easy for me to say that I would love a chance to work together with you.

                            <h3>Communication</h3>
                            <p>In my current and previous roles, I spoke to a
                                variety of people daily to help them through
                                technical, banking, compliance, and trade
                                issues. Code Club volunteering has lead me to
                                help young students learn about software
                                development for their projects. These
                                experiences have developed my ability in
                                troubleshooting issues and finding ways to
                                communicate them in a way the user can
                                understand - this has now translated in
                                communicating the strategies I develop to
                                other teams and how I present data. My work
                                is always adapted to be personal to the client
                                or company using clear language so that ideas
                                can be turned into real solutions.

                            <h3>Teamwork</h3>
                            <p>Throughout my roles and university, I have
                                been involved in projects which have taught
                                me the value of developing a strong team
                                dynamic. Through my roles, I've learned the
                                importance of collaboration to promote
                                internal work culture and to provide the best
                                experience for our users. I believe in
                                cultivating an environment where everyone is
                                comfortable with sharing their ideas and
                                asking questions because this is how I also
                                grew to develop my own skills.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h3>Initiative</h3>
                            <p>I am diligent with my tasks and would never
                                turn down an opportunity to grow my
                                knowledge. I'm always excited to pick up new
                                skills to provide insight and solutions the best I
                                can. This drive to keep asking why, investigating the details,
                                and take in multiple perspectives has meant I've been able
                                to start creating my own projects and solutions in my current
                                role. While I might not have all the answers, I'll
                                have the motivation to learn how to find them.
