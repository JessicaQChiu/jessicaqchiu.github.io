                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-8">
                        <p>I'm a New Zealand business/IT graduate with professional experience working in the financial
                            technology industry hoping to build a career in front-end development.
                            I am open to opportunities in Vancouver or remote work in Canada, and have a work permit so
                            I do not require employment
                            sponsorship.
                            Working as an operations analyst allowed me to build my analytical and writing skills, but I
                            missed developing software
                            which inspired me to take the leap and pursue web development.
                            <br><br>
                            My first experiences with technology included gaming on a boxy PC and when I learned that I
                            could make a change directly to what I saw on the screen, you can bet that I customised my
                            Neopets profile with a fairy wand cursor. Curiousity played a large part in my interest in
                            tech and changing that single cursor design lead me down a path of developing interfaces for
                            friends to use, programming a robotic arm, and volunteering to help spark that same
                            enthusiasm in others.
                            <br><br>
                            I want to move forward by persistently developing my skills, diving into the knowledge
                            of others, collaborating on cool projects, and providing my own perspective too.

                            People have always been at the center of my work and previous roles. I would love the
                            opportunity to be a
                            part of a team that helps create a positive impact on how information is used, communicated,
                            and shared - to help create solutions or paths so people can find them.

                            I hope to collaborate and bring my perspective of inclusion,
                            accessibility, and sustainability when developing strategies or products.
                            <br><br>
                            It's difficult to summarise my sincerity to enter this industry and how I will be diligent
                            in my contributions - but it is easy for me to say
                            that I would love a chance to work together with you to build something valuable.

                            <h3>Communication</h3>
                            <p>In my current and previous roles, I spoke to a
                                variety of people daily to help them through
                                technical, banking, compliance, and trade
                                issues. Code Club volunteering has lead me to
                                help young students learn about software
                                development for their projects. These
                                experiences have developed my ability in
                                troubleshooting issues and finding ways to
                                communicate them in a way the user can
                                understand - this has now translated in
                                communicating the strategies I develop to
                                other teams and how I present data. My work
                                is always adapted to be personal to the client
                                or company using clear language so that ideas
                                can be turned into real solutions.

                            <h3>Teamwork</h3>
                            <p>Throughout my roles and university, I have
                                been involved in projects which have taught
                                me the value of developing a strong team
                                dynamic. Through my roles, I've learned the
                                importance of collaboration to promote
                                internal work culture and to provide the best
                                experience for our users. I believe in
                                cultivating an environment where everyone is
                                comfortable with sharing their ideas and
                                asking questions because this is how I also
                                grew to develop my own skills.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h3>Initiative</h3>
                            <p>I am diligent with my tasks and would never
                                turn down an opportunity to grow my
                                knowledge. I'm always excited to pick up new
                                skills to provide insight and solutions the best I
                                can. This drive to keep asking why, investigating the details,
                                and take in multiple perspectives has meant I've been able
                                to start creating my own projects and solutions in my current
                                role. While I might not have all the answers, I'll
                                have the motivation to learn how to find them.
